/// @notice Validates a trigger against a price source and asks the registry
///         to pay. Holds no value of its own.
///
/// @dev WHY THIS CONTRACT HOLDS NOTHING
///
///      Settlement validates the price condition; PolicyRegistry holds escrow
///      and enforces authorization, lifecycle and payout limits. The registry
///      trusts this authorized contract to validate the condition. Incorrect
///      settlement logic can therefore cause an incorrect payout even when
///      the registry's own checks pass.
///
///      The price source is swappable (IPriceSource). This contract never
///      mentions Chainlink, which is what makes the template reusable rather
///      than a single application. See IPriceSource for why that seam exists
///      and why the official `oracles` adapter layer is not rebuilt here.
